### **Phase 3: Uploading to GitHub**

Now, let's execute the commands to put this online.

1.  **Go to GitHub.com:**
    *   Log in and click the **+** icon in the top right -> **New repository**.
    *   **Repository name:** `ai-native-mimo-6g` (or whatever you prefer).
    *   **Description:** "Official implementation of Phased End-to-End Learning for 6G MIMO".
    *   **Public/Private:** Choose Public (for open source).
    *   **Do NOT** check "Add a README" (since we just made a custom one).
    *   Click **Create repository**.

2.  **Open your terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
    *   Navigate to your project folder:
        ```bash
        cd path/to/your/project_folder
        ```

3.  **Initialize Git:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

4.  **Add your files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    *(This adds all files except the ones we listed in .gitignore)*

5.  **Commit the files:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Grand Master AI implementation"
    ```

6.  **Link to GitHub:**
    *   *Copy the URL from the GitHub page you just created (e.g., https://github.com/YourUser/ai-native-mimo-6g.git)*
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-native-mimo-6g.git
    ```

7.  **Push the code:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

**You are done!** Your project is now live with a professional README that explains your hybrid architecture, curriculum learning, and physics-compliant channel. This looks excellent for your paper submission.
